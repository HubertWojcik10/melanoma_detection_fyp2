# First Year Project (Skin lesion detection)
### A 2nd group project during my 2nd semester at the IT University of Copenhagen.

We were provided with images of skin lesions as well as the knowledge of how to determine whether a lesion is melanoma cancer or not (ABCDE rule). 
Our task was to build a classifier, which could predict from an image whether the lesion is cancerous or not.

**This is our exam submission, not the default project structure that we worked with**
